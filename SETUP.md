# Portfolio Setup Instructions

## Adding Your Photo

To add your professional headshot to the portfolio:

1. **Save your photo** as `val-infante-profile.jpg`
2. **Place it in**: `/Users/valinfante/val-infante-portfolio/assets/images/`
3. The portfolio is already configured to display it on the hero section

### Photo Requirements:
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Recommended size**: 800x800px to 1200x1200px
- **Aspect ratio**: Square or portrait orientation works best
- **File size**: Keep under 500KB for fast loading

### Alternative: Use the image you shared

The professional photo you shared is perfect! Just save it to:
```
/Users/valinfante/val-infante-portfolio/assets/images/val-infante-profile.jpg
```

The portfolio will automatically display it with a MyBambu-branded border and shadow effect.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

Once your photo is in place:

```bash
cd /Users/valinfante/val-infante-portfolio
git add .
git commit -m "Add professional headshot"
git push origin main
```

Your live site will update within 1-2 minutes!
